Whot! is the national card game of Nigeria. It is played by young and old, and has come to be associated with fond memories, by me and a lot of people I know. [Read More](https://www.pagat.com/com/whot.html)

This is a JS Library that will facilitate the Nigerian Whot! Game Play.

## Why

I have started this project because I hope someone else builds a beautiful UI/UX around it (cos I can't).

I also want to play this game with my friends and family from my phone and laptop, and experience the same amount of fun I did playing it as a child.

## How

```bash
npm install whot
```

```ts
import Game from "whot";

const game = new Game({
  noOfDecks: 1, //number of card decks to be used
  noOfPlayers: 4,
});
```

You can subscribe to the [events](./docs/events.md) that the [`Game`](./docs/game.md) instance offers via its `emitter` property.

To play a card:

```js
const player = game.turn.next();

if (player.canPlay()) {
  /** pick a random card from the player's hand */
  const compatibleCardIndex = player
    .hand()
    .findIndex((card) => card.matches(game.pile.top()));
  player.play(compatibleCardIndex);
  game.turn.execute(game.pile.top());
} else {
  const marketCards = player.pick();
  game.turn.switch();
}
```
